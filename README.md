Deployment Instructions:

1. You can Install the apk from folder NewsCatcher, or
2. Build using gradle:
	Open in Android Studio
	Build! Gradle will work for you :)

Screen Shots are in folder ScreenShots
I've used the tinder-like card UI, you can swipe the cards left or right, or favourite it by clicking the middle button on screen.\
Swiping works seamlessly, favourites takes you to appropriate links and so on.
